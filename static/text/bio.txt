<p> I began coding when the pandemic hit, and I haven’t looked back. I enrolled 
at Oregon State University in 2021 to study computer science where I love what 
I’ve learned and work as a teaching assistant in Analysis of Algorithms. I have 
an open mind to most areas of technology and see myself working in cyber security.

<p> When not coding I work as a massage therapist where I help clients get past 
injuries and relieve pain. I have my bachelors in kinesiology from the University
 of Tennessee in Kinesiology. I had plans to get my doctorate in physical therapy 
 until I suffered from medical setbacks and had to change path. Apart from work and 
 school I golf, garden and try every coffee shop I find. It’s been a winding journey 
 and I wouldn’t have it any other way. </p>
